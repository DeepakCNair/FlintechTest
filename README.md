FlintechTest comprises of a front-end and a backend project. 

The front-end project is developed in React and uses proxy to communicate to the backend app. The backend app is developed in .Net Core and is a Web Api project. It leverages HttpClient to communicate with CatApi and passes on data to the front-end Kendo UI Grid.

A typescript functionality named "Club Member Bill Evaluation" has been added to the project (as a console/background task). This functionality is incomplete as it requires some clarification with respect to the workflow.
